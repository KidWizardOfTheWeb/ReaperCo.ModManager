    """
    After you get a dictionary of files, any other dictionary merged in (if it has the same keys as the original)
    will replace the original dictionary's key-pair entries.
    
    i.e.:
    If OGDict has 00.adx and newMod has 00.adx:
        OGDict['00.adx'] is replaced by newMod['00.adx'] in final produced dictionary
        
    This is important because we can essentially take the original dict + all added mods and pull the files we need
    from the final dict to the files folder as needed.
    
    How to calculate final dictionary of needed files:
    Vanilla Game Sys/Files Dicts + any mod dicts = final dict
    
    This works because of the collision handling that python does, where the values for keys being merged into the original
    dict overwrites it.
    
    Once final dict is calculated, move all the files in the dict to the files folder as needed.
    
    To get back to vanilla, user only has to save their mods with none turned on, essentially performing this:
    Vanilla Game Sys/Files Dicts + no mods = final dict
    
    functions to create to handle all of this:
    
    store original vanilla files (in a state where files are NOT easily modified)
    
    generate hashes for new mod
    
    add vanilla file dicts + mod dicts to get final dict
    
    move files to final location from final dict
    
    prevent file mods moving if game is running
    
    How do we return the files though?
    If we calculate a new mod database and the files have been moved, what do we do?
